            <p>A current Computer Science undergraduate at Singapore Management University (SMU), I have a varied range of skills and interests, and am actively seeking internships.</p>
            <p>This general page will include some additional stuff that usually do not make it into my resumes or professional profiles.</p>

                        <p>I have a growing interest in the field of computer graphics, both from the perspective of programming and art. Currently, I have been exploring the art side, experimenting with 3D software like Blender and Maya. I plan to explore the programming side in the near future.</p>

                        <p>Prior to university, I was actively involved with Rails Girls Kuala Lumpur (RGKL). Besides mentoring workshop participants in web development, I organised events for my local city chapter. Fun fact: I also joined Rails Girls London's event as it happened at the same time I was in London for vacation in December 2018.</p>
                        <p>The following are a couple of interviews I have contributed to as part of RGKL:</p>
